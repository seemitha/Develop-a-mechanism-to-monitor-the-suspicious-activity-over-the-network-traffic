# FinalYearProj

# Introduction of the project 

Getting attacked is a troublesome situation and most organization assign technicians to work and prevent the possible attacks over the network.These technicians then provide a defensive barrier against anyone who try to causes trouble in the network.In this project we will be developing a mechanism which can be used for predicting the DDoS attack over the network traffic using Machine learning Algorithm.

# Objectives
To analyse the existing techniques used to detect suspicious activities in network traffic.
To develop a mechanism for detecting suspicious activities in a network traffic. 
To test the mechanism for the detection of suspicious network activities. 
To perform real-time analysis and application.
